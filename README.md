Independently designed and developed **UkilGiri**, a pioneering AI-powered legal assistant and services app for the Bangladeshi market. As a solo project, I handled all aspects from concept to deployment, building with **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore** to make preliminary legal information accessible to everyone in Bengali.

The app provides instant 24/7 assistance on local laws, connects users with legal professionals, and offers a personalized dashboard to track interactions. The application is production-ready and is currently under final review for publication on the Google Play Store.
